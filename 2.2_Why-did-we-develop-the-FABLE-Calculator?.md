We developed the FABLE Calculator because we are convinced models can help frame better policies. First, models describe and explain in a simplified framework how things work. By integrating various sources of existing information, they highlight information gaps and inconsistencies as well as the different parts of a system that are connected. Second, models explore the potential impact of policies that are not in place, or changes that cannot be currently observed. Specifically, scenarios make it possible to test for the consequences of a wide range of "if" assumptions and their most important dependencies.
The FABLE Calculator can identify major imbalances in, and threats to, national food and land-use systems without complex optimization algorithms. It can be opened on almost any computer since Excel is one of the most widely used programs in the world and newer versions are backwards-compatible with older Excel files. Because all of the data is visible and the structure of the functions is clear, the Calculator contains no hidden “black-box” that can obfuscate its weaknesses. Users can quickly select alternative combinations of scenarios and see the impacts on the main indicators. This is an advantage when interacting with stakeholders, as assumptions can be changed easily and transparently. In certain contexts, there may be some value in starting with a simple tool and progressively including more complexity to address clear shortcomings identified by stakeholders, rather than presenting a very complex tool whose value may not be well understood. However, results should be always challenged knowing the limitations of the tool, and some questions simply cannot be answered by the FABLE Calculator because it lacks the necessary complexity (cf. section 4.4 Discussion of the results in FABLE, 2019).
